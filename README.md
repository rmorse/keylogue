# Keylogue
A customisable on screen display of `keyup` and `keydown` events - available in any page and browser via a bookmarklet.

## The bookmarklet

Github won't allow us to embed the bookmarklet here - because that means we would be able to execute scripts on this site (which would be insecure!)

So [save and open this html](/bookmarklet/index.html) file to access the bookmarklet or you can grab it from this post:

## How to use a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a special link that runs javascript on any page you use it on.

First, you need to find the "bookmarklet" (linked above).

Once you have the link you want to use, you can usually add that to your bookmarks bar one of two ways:

1. Right click the link and choose "Add to bookmarks"
2. Drag the link, directly into your bookmarks bar.

More information can be found over at (the Wikipedia entry)][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet#Usage].
