# Keylogue
A customisable on screen display of `keyup` and `keydown` events - available in any page and browser via a bookmarklet.

## Demo + bookmarklet

Github won't allow us to embed the bookmarklet here (probably security...)

View the demo and grab the save bookmarklet here:

## Features

### Works on any site
Bookmarklets live in your browser, so you can access them when visiting any site or project your are working on.

### Displays keys pressed
Keys pressed will display in order and fade away

### Position anywhere
Hover over the keys to access the widget - click and drag on the keys, or the popup menu to reposition on screen

### Custom styles
Customise the keys to fit in with your project by accessing our popup styles panel (from the floating menu) - preloaded with defaults for your tinker with.

### Gets out of your way for screen recordings
No menus / panels will be visible unless you mouse over our UI


## Accessing the hidden menu

Once you have activated the bookmarklet:
- The initial position of the menu is the top left of the screen (you can find it by moving your mouse there)
- Another way to find it - start typing to see your keys - hovering over them will also reveal the menu position
- Drag to move the entire widget around your screen
- Rotate the direction of the keys and fade away
- Open the styles panel


## How to use a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a special link that runs javascript on any page you use it on.

First, you need to find the "bookmarklet" (linked above).

Once you have the link you want to use, you can usually add that to your bookmarks bar one of two ways:

1. Right click the link and choose "Add to bookmarks"
2. Drag the link, directly into your bookmarks bar.

More information can be found over at (the Wikipedia entry)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet#Usage] (I'll update this with a better link at some point soon).
