# Keylogue
A customisable on screen display of `keyup` and `keydown` events - available in any page and browser via a bookmarklet.

## Demo + bookmarklet

Github won't allow us to embed the bookmarklet here (probably security...)

View the demo and grab the save bookmarklet here:

## How to use a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a special link that runs javascript on any page you use it on.

First, you need to find the "bookmarklet" (linked above).

Once you have the link you want to use, you can usually add that to your bookmarks bar one of two ways:

1. Right click the link and choose "Add to bookmarks"
2. Drag the link, directly into your bookmarks bar.

More information can be found over at (the Wikipedia entry)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet#Usage] (I'll update this with a better link at some point soon).
